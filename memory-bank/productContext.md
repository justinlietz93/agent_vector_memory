# Product Context

Streaming cognition platform combining Void Dynamics runtime, Self-Improvement Engine (SIE), and persistent knowledge telemetry.

## Overview

Void Dynamics Model (VDM) executes reasoning as a continuous event-driven stream. The Self-Improvement Engine modulates STDP using reward-driven gating, while topological metrics monitor the emergent Unified Knowledge Graph. Operators interact through vector-memory recall, long-term memory-bank notes, and (soon) a structured VDM knowledge graph.

## Core Features

- Real-time reasoning pipeline with valence-driven speech suppression
- Multi-channel reward modulation (TD error, novelty, habituation, self-benefit)
- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) metrics (M‚ÇÅ, component count) for KG health
- Manual VDM knowledge graph seed enabling future structured recall

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.11+, spiking neural substrates, STDP modulation
- Vector-memory CLI + Ollama embeddings + Qdrant
- Persistent homology tooling (ripser-style) for KG analysis
- Memory-bank markdown system orchestrated by MemoriAgent
